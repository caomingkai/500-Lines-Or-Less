## I. A Template Engine

> Main idea: similar to Python string's **format method** like " A is {title} of B".format(title="father"); Whereas, **template engine** is also a formatter, but much more powerful.
- An important phase in any web application is generating HTML to be served to the browser.
- Very few HTML pages are completely static: they involve at least a small amount of __dynamic data__, such as the user's name. Usually, they contain a great deal of dynamic data: product listings, friends' news updates, and so on.
- The mostly-static style used in templates is the opposite of how most programming languages work.
- A template language flips this around: the template file is mostly static literal text, with special notation to indicate the executable dynamic parts.
